As mentioned earlier there are two main types of cryptography in use today symmetric or secret key cryptography and asymmetric or public key cryptography. Symmetric key cryptography is the oldest type whereas asymmetric cryptography is only being used publicly since the late 1970â€™s 1. Asymmetric cryptography was a major milestone in the search for a perfect encryption scheme.Secret key cryptography goes back to at least Egyptian times and is of concern here. It involves the use of only one key which is used for both encryption and decryption (hence the use of the term symmetric). Figure 2.1 depicts this idea. It is necessary for security purposes that the secret key never be revealed.To accomplish encryption, most secret key algorithms use two main techniques known as substitution and permutation. Substitution is simply a mapping of one value to another whereas permutation is a reordering of the bit positions for each of the inputs. These techniques are used a number of times in iterations called rounds. Generally, the more rounds there are, the more secure the algorithm. A non linearity is also introduced into the encryption so that decryption will be computationally infeasible 2 without the secret key. This is achieved with the use of S-boxes which are basically non-linear substitution tables where either the output is smaller than the input or vice versa.One of the main problems with secret key cryptography is key distribution.For this form of cryptography to work,both parties must have a copy of the secret key. This would have to be communicated over some secure channel which,unfortunately,is not that easy to achieve. As will be seen later, puplic key cryptography provides a solution to this.
